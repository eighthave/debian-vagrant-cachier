# Benchmarks

During the early days of this plugin, [@fgrehm](https://github.com/fgrehm) wrote
a [blog post](http://fabiorehm.com/blog/2013/05/24/stop-wasting-bandwidth-with-vagrant-cachier#show_me_the_numbers)
with some benchmarks on the time that was cut down by using the plugin. If you
are interested on the numbers only, the VMs tested were one of vagrant-lxc's
Ubuntu [dev boxes](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/wiki/Development#using-virtualbox-for-development),
[rails-dev-box](https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box), his own [rails-base-box](https://github.com/fgrehm/rails-base-box)
and Discourse's [dev box](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/Vagrantfile)

be a bit different_

Some people have shared their numbers on Twitter and had experienced even better
results:
